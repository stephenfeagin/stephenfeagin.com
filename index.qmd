I'm a data analyst and developer who is passionate about working for social good. I have previously worked as a Data Operations Engineer at [Arcadia](https://arcadia.io) and a Data Specialist at [Connecticut RISE Network](https://ctrise.org).

I primarily use Python for general programming and web development, and R for statistics and data work. I enjoy coding in Go but I'm still somewhat novice in it, as I've only ever used it in a hobby setting. I always like trying out new languages (like Julia, which I find super interesting but have never really gotten into). Iâ€™m particularly interested in the role that data and software tools can play in non-profits and organizations that advance social good.
