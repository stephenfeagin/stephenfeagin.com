I'm still deeply passionate about education, and that of course spills over into a passion for education data. So in looking for a portfolio project, my first inclination was to do an analysis of open education data.\n\nI have decided to take a look at North Carolina, my home state and a place that still holds special meaning for me. Luckily for me, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) has a good deal of openly available datasets to work with. They're somewhat scattered and perhaps not as easy to navigate as one might like, but it's great to have access to high quality, relevant data. In exploring what datasets were available, I settled on a simple question to investigate.\n\nThis project is written in R markdown and is fully reproducible using data files that I list below. My goal is to present the methodical process of the analysis, rather than putting forward a piece of data journalism reporting on the findings.\n\n# Question\n\nDoes performance on the North Carolina End of Course (EOC) English II exam predict performance on the ACT and SAT English sections?\n\nThis analysis covers only English because of data problems with the mathematics EOCs. There are three math EOCs, and some data sets have them specifically labeled \"Math 1\" or similar, some only have \"Math,\" and no years have more than one math exam reported; they're all the same code (all \"Math 1\" or all \"Math,\" not separate entries for different math exams). For this project, I prefer not to make assumptions about which math exam each dataset is dealing with, so I've limited the scope to just English.\n\n# Data\n\nI am using data files from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. The main site for these data reports is https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting.\n\n- The EOC data files are spread throughout the Accountability Report Archive at https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting/accountability-data-sets-and-reports/accountability-report-archive\n- The ACT results are in the files at https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting/act-reports\n- The SAT results are in the files at https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting/north-carolina-sat-and-ap-reports\n\n\nI have altered file names for consistency across years, but it is easy to locate the originals on the DPI website.\n\nI will be using data for school years 2016-17 through 2018-2019. Data is available for 2020-2021, but the EOC scores are reported differently -- instead of reporting percents at level 1 and 2, it combines them into a single \"not proficient\" field. I could potentially impute the value 1.5 but I don't think I could justify that move.\n\n## Files Used\n\nBelow are links to the data files that I used for this analysis.\n\n| Year | EOC | ACT | SAT |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| 2016-17 | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/americanindianed/reports/2016-17-end-grade-and-end-course-test-results/download) | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/fbs/finance/reporting/2015-16-results-11th-grade-act/download) | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/images/newsroom/2017/2016-2017-nc-public-schools-sat-performance/download)  |\n| 2017-18 | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/americanindianed/reports/data-report/download) | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/americanindianed/reports/2017-18-results-11th-graders-act/download)|[link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/images/newsroom/2018/2017-18-nc-sat-performance-overview/download)|\n| 2018-19 | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/data-report2019-final/download) |[link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/fbs/finance/reporting/actresults1819-final/download) | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/fbs/finance/reporting/2019-sat-performance-district-school/download) |\n\n# Method\n\nAs always, start by loading in the necessary libraries.\n\n```{r libraries, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n```\n\n## EOC\n\nThere are a couple of challenges with the raw data files. First, they contain data for all schools and school districts, for all tests including the primary school level End of Grade tests and the math and biology EOCs, which are not relevant here. So we need to filter down to only the data that we need. \n\nSecond, the EOC scores are not reported as an average score for a particular school. Rather, they're reported as a distribution: percent of students who scored a 1, percent who scored 2, etc. For very small schools, there are times where there are very few students in a given category. In these instances, the scores are suppressed either entirely by giving the value as \"*\" or by saying \"<5%\" or \">95%\". I have opted to remove the rows with NA values entirely. For the rows with \"<5%\" and \">95%\", I have made the decision to replace those with 2.5 and 97.5, respectively. In some cases this may make the overall percentages not equal exactly 100, but as a rough approximation I think it's reasonable. I do this through a function used across all four years:\n\n```{r}\nfill_in_scores <- function(x) {\n  sapply(x, function(y) {\n    if (y == \"<5\") {\n    return(2.5)\n  } else if (y == \">95\") {\n    return(97.5)\n  } else {\n    return(y)\n  }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n\nAfter scrubbing those values, I then collapse the distribution into a single mean:\n\n$$\\text{E}[score] = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_{i}i$$\nwhere $i$ is the score, 1 through 5, and $p_i$ is the proportion of students attaining that score.\n\nAfter that, it's a simple matter of adding a year indicator in each individual file and selecting out only the relevant columns.\n\nThis process is repeated for all four years. I go through step-by-step for the 2016-17 file, then consolidate the code into a single pipeline for the remaining three.\n\n### 2016-17\n\nRead in file:\n```{r}\neoc_1617 <- read_excel(\n  \"2016-17

100\n  )\n```\n\nSelect only the relevant columns:\n\n```{r}\neoc_1617 <- eoc_1617 %>% \n  select(school_code, school_name, eoc_english = mean_score)\n```\n\nAdd a field for year, using the ending

We can see that with the possible exception of the SAT correlation, the relationships between EOC scores and the national tests are well approximated by a simple linear model. It looks like the slope of the SAT ~ EOC line would be steeper if not for some high-leverage data points with higher EOC scores and lower SAT scores.\n\nConfirming the impression that scores have been consistent over time, we see through regression analysis that the year variable is not statistically significant in any of the models.\n\n### EOC and SAT\n\n#### Regression\n\n```{r results=\"asis\"}\neoc_sat_model <- lm(sat_erw ~ eoc_english + year, data = dataset)\n```\n\n| **Variable** | **Coefficient** | **Standard Error** |\n|-:|:-:|:-:|\n| EOC | `r summary(eoc_sat_model)$coefficients[\"eoc_english\", \"Estimate\"]` | `r summary(eoc_sat_model)$coefficients[\"eoc_english\", \"Std.

I'm still deeply passionate about education, and that of course spills over into a passion for education data. So in looking for a portfolio project, my first inclination was to do an analysis of open education data.\n\nI have decided to take a look at North Carolina, my home state and a place that still holds special meaning for me. Luckily for me, the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction (NCDPI) has a good deal of openly available datasets to work with. They're somewhat scattered and perhaps not as easy to navigate as one might like, but it's great to have access to high quality, relevant data. In exploring what datasets were available, I settled on a simple question to investigate.\n\nThis project is written in R markdown and is fully reproducible using data files that I list below. My goal is to present the methodical process of the analysis, rather than putting forward a piece of data journalism reporting on the findings.\n\n# Question\n\nDoes performance on the North Carolina End of Course (EOC) English II exam predict performance on the ACT and SAT English sections?\n\nThis analysis covers only English because of data problems with the mathematics EOCs. There are three math EOCs, and some data sets have them specifically labeled \"Math 1\" or similar, some only have \"Math,\" and no years have more than one math exam reported; they're all the same code (all \"Math 1\" or all \"Math,\" not separate entries for different math exams). For this project, I prefer not to make assumptions about which math exam each dataset is dealing with, so I've limited the scope to just English.\n\n# Data\n\nI am using data files from the North Carolina Department of Public Instruction. The main site for these data reports is https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting.\n\n- The EOC data files are spread throughout the Accountability Report Archive at https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting/accountability-data-sets-and-reports/accountability-report-archive\n- The ACT results are in the files at https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting/act-reports\n- The SAT results are in the files at https://www.dpi.nc.gov/districts-schools/testing-and-school-accountability/school-accountability-and-reporting/north-carolina-sat-and-ap-reports\n\n\nI have altered file names for consistency across years, but it is easy to locate the originals on the DPI website.\n\nI will be using data for school years 2016-17 through 2018-2019. Data is available for 2020-2021, but the EOC scores are reported differently -- instead of reporting percents at level 1 and 2, it combines them into a single \"not proficient\" field. I could potentially impute the value 1.5 but I don't think I could justify that move.\n\n## Files Used\n\nBelow are links to the data files that I used for this analysis.\n\n| Year | EOC | ACT | SAT |\n|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|\n| 2016-17 | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/americanindianed/reports/2016-17-end-grade-and-end-course-test-results/download) | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/fbs/finance/reporting/2015-16-results-11th-grade-act/download) | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/images/newsroom/2017/2016-2017-nc-public-schools-sat-performance/download)  |\n| 2017-18 | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/americanindianed/reports/data-report/download) | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/americanindianed/reports/2017-18-results-11th-graders-act/download)|[link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/images/newsroom/2018/2017-18-nc-sat-performance-overview/download)|\n| 2018-19 | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/data-report2019-final/download) |[link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/fbs/finance/reporting/actresults1819-final/download) | [link](https://www.dpi.nc.gov/documents/fbs/finance/reporting/2019-sat-performance-district-school/download) |\n\n# Method\n\nAs always, start by loading in the necessary libraries.\n\n```{r libraries, message=FALSE}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(readxl)\nlibrary(tidyr)\n```\n\n## EOC\n\nThere are a couple of challenges with the raw data files. First, they contain data for all schools and school districts, for all tests including the primary school level End of Grade tests and the math and biology EOCs, which are not relevant here. So we need to filter down to only the data that we need. \n\nSecond, the EOC scores are not reported as an average score for a particular school. Rather, they're reported as a distribution: percent of students who scored a 1, percent who scored 2, etc. For very small schools, there are times where there are very few students in a given category. In these instances, the scores are suppressed either entirely by giving the value as \"*\" or by saying \"<5%\" or \">95%\". I have opted to remove the rows with NA values entirely. For the rows with \"<5%\" and \">95%\", I have made the decision to replace those with 2.5 and 97.5, respectively. In some cases this may make the overall percentages not equal exactly 100, but as a rough approximation I think it's reasonable. I do this through a function used across all four years:\n\n```{r}\nfill_in_scores <- function(x) {\n  sapply(x, function(y) {\n    if (y == \"<5\") {\n    return(2.5)\n  } else if (y == \">95\") {\n    return(97.5)\n  } else {\n    return(y)\n  }\n  })\n}\n```\n\n\nAfter scrubbing those values, I then collapse the distribution into a single mean:\n\n$$\\text{E}[score] = \\sum_{i=1}^{5} p_{i}i$$\nwhere $i$ is the score, 1 through 5, and $p_i$ is the proportion of students attaining that score.\n\nAfter that, it's a simple matter of adding a year indicator in each individual file and selecting out only the relevant columns.\n\nThis process is repeated for all four years. I go through step-by-step for the 2016-17 file, then consolidate the code into a single pipeline for the remaining three.\n\n### 2016-17\n\nRead in file:\n```{r}\neoc_1617 <- read_excel(\n  \"2016-17

These show considerable consistency of scores over time.\n\n### EOC\n\n```{r}\nggplot(dataset, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = eoc_english)) +\n  geom_boxplot() + \n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"EOC Score\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n### ACT English\n\n```{r}\nggplot(dataset, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = act_english)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"ACT English Score\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n### ACT Reading\n\n```{r}\nggplot(dataset, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = act_reading)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"ACT Reading Score\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n### ACT Writing\n\n```{r}\nggplot(dataset, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = act_writing)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"ACT Writing Score\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n### SAT\n\n```{r}\nggplot(dataset, aes(x = as.factor(year), y = sat_erw)) +\n  geom_boxplot() +\n  labs(x = \"Year\", y = \"SAT ERW Score\") +\n  theme_bw()\n```\n\n## Correlations\n\nI now look at the main focus of the analysis: the correlation between EOC scores and ACT/SAT scores. We can see that with the possible exception of the SAT correlation, the relationships between EOC scores and the national tests are well approximated by a simple linear model. It looks like the slope of the SAT ~ EOC line would be steeper if not for some high-leverage data points with higher EOC scores and lower SAT scores.\n\nConfirming the impression that scores have been consistent over time, we see through regression analysis that the year variable is not statistically significant in any of the models.\n\n### EOC and SAT\n\n#### Regression\n\n```{r results=\"asis\"}\neoc_sat_model <- lm(sat_erw ~ eoc_english + year, data = dataset)\n```\n\n| **Variable** | **Coefficient** | **Standard Error** |\n|-:|:-:|:-:|\n| EOC | `r summary(eoc_sat_model)$coefficients[\"eoc_english\", \"Estimate\"]` | `r summary(eoc_sat_model)$coefficients[\"eoc_english\", \"Std.

The year the exam was taken does not meaningfully impact the relationship, because scores are remarkably stable over the time period in question.\n"},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true,"format-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"toc":true,"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table
